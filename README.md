## Long Description

We are trying to level the global market rate of language education. Education and especially languages are a global good, so we want to help even the playing field by creating work opportunities that benefit people in lower income countries. 

With DAOlingo, any user has the opportunity to learn and / or practice languages. The dAPP will connect you to a native speaker of the language that you want to practice. Similarly to an uber like system, the user will be matched with a native speaker that is currently available and wants to take on your request. 

How it works: 
The user sets a budget on how much (per second/block/minute/hour) he / she is willing to pay for talking to a native speaker. All available native speakers will see a call to action whereby they can accept the call. Once a native speaker accepts the call, the clock starts to count. The native speaker is paid a rate that the student set initially. Here the novelty is that the student only pays for the amount of time he / she is actually talking to the native speaker. Once the call is ended, the clock stops to count and the payment transaction will be completed seamlessly. 

Benefits for Teachers: 
Native speakers (teachers) from for example Venezuela have the opportunity to create additional income streams, earn currencies that are protected from hyperinflation and have flexible working hours, which means they can work whenever they have time.

Benefits for Students (Why would anyone want to use DAOlingo?): 
In short convenience and practicality. With DAOlingo you have 
1) 24/7 access to native speakers (teachers) â€“ so you can take up your practice no matter where you are and what you are doing 
2) You  only pay for the time you are practicing without time commitment 
3) You pay in whatever crypto currency you own 

Benefits compared to competition (ie. ITalki): 
> Low fees because it is powered by crypto
> Fostering financial inclusion, as we are providing access to financial means to a group of people that do not have access to traditional banking systems
> DAO aspect, that allows for the community to shape and determine the future of the company
## How We Made it

DAOlingo is combing a bunch of technologies out there (especially technologies from projects that are at the event). We have tried to bring the technologies of
HUDDLE01, SUPERFLUID on CELO mainnet.

We can also provide support for the following projects and protocols:
Uniswap, Ethereum, AAVE, Polygon, Taiko, Apecoin, Scroll and Superfluid all under one hood. 

Main Tech: 
CELO - deployed on mainnet 
SUPERFLUID - used for pay per second / block 
HUDDLE01 - Using Huddle01 to connect the student and the teacher. 

To break it down: 
Form of Payment: 
> APE (We created Super Token for APE to support the money streams of SuperFluid, and we can easily use it for other chains) 
> UNI 
> GHO

Also deployed on:  
Polygon
